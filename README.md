# ðŸš€ Skeleton for lab terraform and instructions ðŸ§ª

Have fun! ðŸŽ‰

1. Use this repo as a [template](https://github.ibm.com/cloud-labs/skeleton/generate) for your lab preparation (with terraform!) and instructions (with [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/)!).
1. Enable `Pages` in your repo, pointing to the `main` branch and the `docs` folder.
1. Obtain a [GHE token](https://github.ibm.com/settings/tokens/new). Token should have `admin:org`, `repo` permissions to read public and private repos.
1. Before the conference, move this repo from GitHub Enterprise to GitHub public.

## ðŸ“‚ Directory structure

| File or directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [docs](./docs/) | Lab instructions |
| [terraform](./terraform/) | Automation to prepare the lab |

## Get started

Edit [](./terraform/inputs.tf) and change

skeleton-1234 to code-session


## ðŸ“– Edit instructions

1. Use [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) to create your lab instructions under [docs](./docs/).
1. View the website locally with:
   ```sh
   python -m http.server --directory docs --bind 0.0.0.0 8080
   ```

## ðŸš€ Deploy through Schematics

You can choose to run terraform locally of course. Or you can decide to do it with Schematics so that the state is in the Cloud.

1. Copy `template.local.env` to `local.env`:
   ```sh
   cp template.local.env local.env
   ```
1. Configure `local.env`
1. Run `(source local.env && ./create-or-update-workspace.sh)` to create a Schematics workspace to deploy your resources.
1. Go to https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/workspaces, select the workspace.
1. Under **Settings**, set variables.
1. Click **Apply plan**.
1. Use `(source local.env && ./get-credentials.sh)` to retrieve the `credentials.csv` file.

## ðŸ’» Deploy locally

1. To retrieve the shared terraform modules, create a `.netrc` file under your home directory with the following content:
   ```sh
   machine github.ibm.com
   login <your-github-enterprise-username>
   password <a-personal-github-enterprise-token-with-read-permissions>
   ```
1. Copy `template.local.env` to `local.env`:
   ```sh
   cp template.local.env local.env
   ```
1. Configure `local.env`
1. Load environment:
   ```sh
   source local.env
   ```
1. Apply:
   ```sh
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
