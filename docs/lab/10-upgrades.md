# üîÑ Approaches to MongoDB Major Version Upgrades
There are several approaches to perform a MongoDB major version upgrade, depending on your environment (replica set, sharded cluster, standalone) and your tolerance for downtime. Each has tradeoffs in risk, downtime, and complexity.


## 1. **In-Place Rolling Upgrade (Recommended for HA Clusters)**

Upgrade one node at a time while the cluster stays online.

**How it works:**

* Stop a **secondary** node, upgrade binaries, restart, validate.
* Repeat for all secondaries.
* Step down the **primary** and upgrade it last.
* For sharded clusters: upgrade config servers ‚Üí shard replica sets ‚Üí mongos routers.

**Pros:**

* Zero/minimal downtime (if replica set/quorum maintained).
* Supported directly by MongoDB documentation.
* No extra infrastructure needed.

**Cons:**

* Slower overall process (many steps).
* Risk of version skew if a node misbehaves.
* Doesn‚Äôt allow skipping multiple major versions.

**Best for:**
Production replica sets & sharded clusters where uptime is critical.

---

## 2. **In-Place Standalone Upgrade (For Non-Clustered Instances)**

Stop the instance, upgrade binaries, restart.

**How it works:**

* Shut down `mongod`.
* Replace binaries with new version.
* Restart and set new Feature Compatibility Version (FCV).

**Pros:**

* Simple.
* Quick for small test or dev environments.

**Cons:**

* Full downtime during upgrade.
* No fallback without backups/snapshots.

**Best for:**
Development environments or low-criticality systems.

---

## 3. **Blue-Green / Parallel Cluster Upgrade**

Run old and new clusters side by side, cut over once validated.

**How it works:**

* Build a new cluster with the target MongoDB version.
* Sync data via replication.
* Point applications to the new cluster once validated.

**Pros:**

* Safe rollback (just switch traffic back).
* Lets you test workloads on the new version ahead of cutover.

**Cons:**

* Requires double infrastructure temporarily.
* Data sync can be tricky for large datasets.
* Cutover might involve downtime unless dual writes are implemented.

**Best for:**
Large enterprises or risk-averse teams needing a tested fallback.

---

## 4. **Logical Backup & Restore Upgrade**

Export/import data between versions.

**How it works:**

* Use `mongodump` from old version.
* Install new binaries.
* Use `mongorestore` into new version.

**Pros:**

* Works across big version gaps (with care).
* Cleans up old metadata/index issues.

**Cons:**

* Full downtime during dump/restore.
* Not practical for large datasets.
* Risk of data inconsistency if not carefully quiesced.

**Best for:**
Small datasets, test migrations, dev environments.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Decision Factors

* **Downtime tolerance**: If downtime is unacceptable ‚Üí choose *rolling upgrade* or *blue-green*.
* **Dataset size**: Logical dump/restore doesn‚Äôt scale for large data.
* **Infrastructure**: If you can provision duplicate clusters ‚Üí blue-green is safest.


## üîÑ Manual Upgrade Journey: In-Place Rolling Upgrade (HA Replica Set)

We‚Äôll walk through upgrading a **replica set cluster** across a major MongoDB version, while keeping the service online.

The high-level steps are:
1. Confirm health & FCV.
2. Put cluster read-only ‚Üí backup ‚Üí unlock writes.
3. Upgrade secondaries (one at a time).
4. Step down primary ‚Üí upgrade it.
5. Set FCV to new version.
6. Validate & test.

### 1. Preparation

1. **Confirm supported upgrade path**

   * MongoDB only supports upgrading **one major version at a time** (e.g., 4.2 ‚Üí 4.4, not 4.2 ‚Üí 5.0).

2. **Check cluster health**

   ```javascript
   rs.status()
   db.adminCommand({ serverStatus: 1 })
   ```

   * Ensure all members are `PRIMARY` or `SECONDARY`.
   * No replication lag.

3. **Check Feature Compatibility Version (FCV)**

   ```javascript
   db.adminCommand({ getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 })
   ```

   * Must be set to the **current version** before upgrading binaries.
   * If not:

     ```javascript
     db.adminCommand({ setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "X.Y" }) // e.g., "6.0"
     ```

---

### 2. Backup (Cluster Read-Only)

To guarantee a consistent snapshot:

1. **Put the cluster in read-only mode**

   * Connect to the **PRIMARY** and enter:

     ```javascript
     db.fsyncLock()
     ```

     This flushes data to disk and blocks writes.

   * ‚ö†Ô∏è Reads are still possible, but **all writes are blocked** until unlocked.

2. **Take a backup**

   * Options:

     * **Logical backup:**

       ```bash
       mongodump --host <primaryHost> --out /backups/upgrade-<date>
       ```
     * **Filesystem snapshot:**

       * Take a snapshot at the storage layer (LVM, EBS, SAN, etc.).

3. **Unlock writes**

   ```javascript
   db.fsyncUnlock()
   ```

‚úÖ Now you have a consistent backup before the upgrade begins.

### 3. Rolling Upgrade (Node by Node)

#### Step A: Upgrade a Secondary

1. Pick a **SECONDARY** node.
2. Stop the `mongod` process.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop mongod
   ```
3. Upgrade binaries (replace old MongoDB packages with new ones).

   * Example (Ubuntu):

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org=<newVersion>
     ```
4. Restart `mongod`:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   ```
5. Validate:

   * Ensure it rejoins replica set (`rs.status()`).
   * Check logs for errors.
   * Run a basic read query.

---

#### Step B: Repeat for All Secondaries

* One by one, upgrade each **remaining SECONDARY** node.
* Always validate before moving on.

---

#### Step C: Upgrade the Primary

1. **Step down the Primary** (forces election):

   ```javascript
   rs.stepDown()
   ```

   * A healthy SECONDARY becomes PRIMARY.

2. Upgrade the old primary (now a secondary) using the same steps:

   * Stop `mongod`.
   * Upgrade binaries.
   * Restart and validate.

---

## 4. Post-Upgrade Steps

1. **Verify all nodes are on new version**

   ```javascript
   db.version()
   ```

2. **Re-enable feature compatibility for new version**

   ```javascript
   db.adminCommand({ setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "<newVersion>" }) 
   ```

   * Example:

     ```javascript
     db.adminCommand({ setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "7.0" })
     ```

3. **Monitor cluster health**

   ```javascript
   rs.status()
   db.serverStatus()
   ```

4. **Test application workload**

   * Run smoke tests from your app against the upgraded cluster before putting the application live.
