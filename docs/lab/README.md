# Automate major database version migrations without the headaches

Upgrading Databases like MongoDB between major versions is a critical but often complex task. Unlike minor updates, which are straightforward package updates, major version upgrades require careful planning, testing, and validation to avoid downtime or data loss.

MongoDB major versions bring:

- New features and performance improvements

- Security enhancements

- Bug fixes and deprecations

‚ö†Ô∏è But: Skipping careful planning can lead to downtime, data incompatibilities, or failed upgrades. That‚Äôs why this lab is focused on a seamless, zero/minimal downtime upgrade path.

If you‚Äôre running your own MongoDB infrastructure, this can be time-consuming and error-prone ‚Äî juggling backups, downtime windows, feature compatibility, and rollback planning.

üëâ This lab introduces you to how the upgrade process works when you manage MongoDB yourself, and then shows you how IBM Cloud Databases takes all that complexity away. With IBM Cloud Databases recently introduced in place major version upgrades, upgrades are automated, seamless, and built to avoid downtime, letting you focus on your applications instead of database plumbing.

**In this lab, you will:**
1. Learn what steps are necessary to upgrade your own MongoDB servers.
2. Understand how in-place major version upgrades work in IBM Cloud Databases.
3. Exercise an automated upgrade of a MongoDB instance with IBM Cloud Databases.
