# Automate major database version migrations without the headaches

Upgrading Databases like PostgreSQL between major versions is a critical but often complex task. Unlike minor updates, which are straightforward package updates, major version upgrades require careful planning, testing, and validation to avoid downtime or data loss.

If youâ€™re running your own PostgreSQL infrastructure, this can be time-consuming and error-prone â€” juggling backups, downtime windows, extension compatibility, and rollback planning.

ðŸ‘‰ This lab introduces you to how the upgrade process works when you manage PostgreSQL yourself, and then shows you how IBM Cloud Databases takes all that complexity away. With IBM Cloud Databases recently introduced in place major version upgrades, upgrades are automated, seamless, and built to minimize downtime, letting you focus on your applications instead of database plumbing.

**In this lab, you will:**
1. Learn what steps are necessary to upgrade your own PostgreSQL servers.
2. Understand how in-place major version upgrades work in IBM Cloud Databases.
3. Exercise an automated upgrade of a PostgreSQL instance with IBM Cloud Databases.
